CodeFusion: Multi-Domain Programming Challenge
(This idea came while selecting the Question1 domain)
1. Brief Description
    CodeFusion can be a hands-on coding event where participants tackle challenges across three distinct programming domains: 
    web development, machine learning, and algorithm design. 
    The event would be structured to be feasible and engaging, allowing participants to apply their skills practically and showcase their problem-solving abilities.

2. Required Skills
    ->Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular).
    ->Machine Learning: Python, data analysis, and libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
    ->Algorithm Design: Proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
3. Format and Structure
    Registration and Team Formation

        Teams of 2-4 members with diverse skills register for the event.
        Teams can self-form or be assigned based on skill profiles if needed.
    Event Structure

        Day 1: Kick-Off and Initial Challenge

            Morning: Opening ceremony and problem statement presentation.
            Provide detailed descriptions and requirements for each challenge (Web Development, Machine Learning, Algorithm Design).
            Afternoon: Teams choose one challenge to start with and begin working.
       
        Day 2: Challenge Switching

            Morning: Teams continue working on their initial challenge.
            Afternoon: Teams switch to a different challenge.
            Continue working with access to support channels for technical assistance.

        Day 3: Final Work and Presentation

            Morning: Finalize solutions for all challenges.
            Afternoon: Teams prepare and deliver their presentations.
            Each team presents their solutions, covering all three challenges.

    Support and Resources

        Technical Support: Provide online channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) for real-time assistance during the event.
        Resources: Access to required tools, datasets, and documentation.
        Judging Criteria
            Web Development: Usability, design, functionality, and responsiveness.
            Machine Learning: Model accuracy, innovation, and practical applicability.
            Algorithm Design: Efficiency, correctness, and optimality of solutions.
         Prizes and Recognition
             Awards for the best solutions in each challenge.
            Certificates of participation for all teams.
            Opportunities for top teams to present their solutions to industry professionals.


4. Timeline and Logistics
    Preparation Period:

        One week before the event to distribute challenge details and guidelines.

    Event Duration:
        Day 1: Kick-off, start with initial challenge.
        Day 2: Switch to the second challenge.
        Day 3: Finalize and present solutions.
    
    Venue:
        Provide a suitable location with workspace, internet access, and presentation facilities.
        Ensure availability of refreshments and necessary equipment.
    
    Technical Support:
        Have mentors or experts available online to assist with any issues during the event.
